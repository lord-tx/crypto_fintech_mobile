  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/images/home_page_bg.png
    - assets/images/slider_graphic_1.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Rogerex
     fonts:
       - asset: assets/rogerex-font/RogerexMedium.ttf
         weight: 400
       - asset: assets/rogerex-font/RogerexRegular.ttf
         weight: 500
       - asset: assets/rogerex-font/RogerexBold.ttf
         weight: 700

   - family: IBMPlexMono
     fonts:
       - asset: assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Light.ttf
         weight: 400
       - asset: assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.ttf
         weight: 500
       - asset: assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Bold.ttf
         weight: 700

   - family: DM
     fonts:
